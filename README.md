# Proof-of-Work experiment
Simple Proof-of-Work experiment in Python

## About
This program is a minimal-experiment to better understand how a proof-of-work algorithm works similar to the ones used for systems like BitCoin, mailing, DoS, etc. It reads a prototype string and calculates the SHA256 hash probabilities based on the required level of success (aka leading zeroes).

The amount of work varies from 0 until the max length of the SHA256 hash. As of January of 2018 the last Tx hash registered on [BlockChain](https://blockchain.info/pt/block/00000000000000000069c3e4feec27bc15e3a4d343a78221e12e4a331efaa44f) was `00000000000000000069c3e4feec27bc15e3a4d343a78221e12e4a331efaa44f`, which contains 17 leading zeroes and would be represented as `--level=17`, although it's not recommended to try out this amount of work level as your CPU cycle and accomplishment time would be way high.
